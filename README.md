## About this App

This app will be a practice tool for musiciancs to train their aural knowledge of different sounding scales. The App will have a master loop to allow the user to access the three main sections of the app: a starting area, quiz area, and a library. 
The starting area will allow the user to go into the quiz area, the library, or close the app.
The testing section will be quizz the user on thier knowledge of the scales. The scale will sound and the user will have to input the correct scale to gain a point. At the end of the ten questions the app will let the user know how they did and what questions they missed.
